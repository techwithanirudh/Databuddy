Always ensure type-safety, don't use type: any unless needed, when creating APIs, responses, or components, create proper interfaces and make them in the shared types folders where it fits best, not in the same file

When working on anything, try to split off components, utils, anything reusable to ensure better loading speed and less complexity

LESS COMPLEXITY IS BETTER, the fewer lines, the less complex logic the better

Naming convention is lower-case-like-this

Think about mobile responsiveness when doing any UI tasks or changes

NEVER add placeholders, mock data, or anything similar

Always use rounded, not rounded-xl or rounded-md, always rounded

ALWAYS use bun, never npm, never pnpm, just bun

Don't use lucide for icons, ONLY use phosphor icons, use width="duotone" for most, but for arrows use fill, for plus icons don't add width

Handle complex data transformations independently of React.
Keep these modules decoupled from React for improved modularity and testability.
View Components:

Decouple state management, data transformations, and API interactions from the React lifecycle.
Simplify data flow to eliminate prop drilling and callback hell.
Prioritize modularity and testability in all components.

Never throw errors in server actions, use try catch and return the error to the client

For all blogs and content pages, add TL;DRs near the title on the top for better conversion

ALWAYS use error boundaries properly

use console properly, like console.error, console.time, console.json, console.table, etc

Use Dayjs NEVER date-fns, and Tanstack query for hooks, NEVER SWR

use Icon at the end of phosphor react icons, like CaretIcon not Caret AND THATS THE DEFAULT IMPORT, NOT AS

use json.stringify() when adding debugging

Almost NEVER use useEffect unless it's critical
